"""
Welcome to BlackJack! Get as close to 21 as you can without going over!

Game dynamics (1 dealer vs 1 player):
    1. We start with two cards face up for the player and two cards,
    one face down and one face up, for the dealer.

    2. If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card, and the dealer does not,
        the player wins

    3. Dealer asks the player if he wants to Hit (get more cards)
        or Stand (stop receving)

    4. If the player exceeds a sum of 21 ("busts"), the player loses,
        even if the dealer also exceeds 21.

    5. Once the player Stands, it's the dealer's turn.

    6. The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hit until the cards
        total up to 17 points.

    7. If the dealer exceeds 21 ("busts") and the player does not; the player wins.

    9. If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and does not bust;
        the player wins (and vice versa).

    10. If both dealer and player have the same sum, called a "push", no one wins
